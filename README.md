# Hardware
The hardware of the Hackulator.
There are quite a few items you will need for this project.
You will first need a board. We used a Feather M0 Adalogger. It costs $19.95. You can get it from here : https://www.adafruit.com/product/2796

You will also need a LCD display that connects to the board. It costs $6.00. You can get it here : https://www.banggood.com/2_4-Inch-TFT-LCD-Shield-240320-Touch-Board-Display-Module-With-Touch-Pen-For-Arduino-UNO-p-1171082.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN

You will need a 4x4 matrix keypad as well. We will provide you with a link for it, but you could get something else. If you do, you <strong><marquee>would</strong></marquee> have to change the source code. Here is the one we use : https://vetco.net/products/16-button-tactile-keypad-matrix?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyNjRBRCpARIsAPDBnn3ZnXydUdvJU3ZJUw1Z2aYWGQDY6PvrF5akD408bwsabfrwnfimv1oaAoYPEALw_wcB

You will also need a breadboard to connect everything with.
A battery is also required to run the arduino. Here is the link to the 1200mAh battery. https://www.adafruit.com/product/258

The music player feature is included in this project. An option to listen to music is to buy a headphone jack. Here is the headphone jack : https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12639
